# Hello welcome to my first React App

It is very well known that when you want to learn a new programming language or a new technology, that it is essential to start with a basic project.
<br>I chose to start my React Dev adventure by creating my own todo list.
<br><br>
I made the choice to have a more complex todo list application than what you can find on some tutorials.<br><br>
Here, you can create several todo lists named like cards that contain a description and several tasks to accomplish.

# Uses
